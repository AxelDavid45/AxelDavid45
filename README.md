### Hi, I'm Axel Espinosa.ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ðŸŒ®

I'm a software engineer passionate about building solutions that truly add value. I mainly work as a fullstack developer, using technologies like Node.js, React, MongoDB, and NestJS. I especially enjoy projects where I can learn something new, design clean architectures, and tackle technical challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.
