### Hi there ✌. I'm Axel Espinosa from Mexico 🇲🇽. 

My expertise spans React, Node.js, and API development, where I've created solutions that significantly improve user experiences. I'm a strong advocate for code quality and maintainability, often leading refactoring efforts and integrating best practices. Collaborative by nature, I excel in cross-functional teams, aligning projects with business goals.
