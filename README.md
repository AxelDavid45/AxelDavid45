### Hi there ✌. I'm Axel Espinosa from Mexico 🇲🇽. I'm a student of systems engineering 🤓 passionate about web technologies, especially I work on the backend. I feel comfortable using PHP and I'm also learning JS to use it on the backend with NodeJs🚀. Besides, I share some of the knowledge I have on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-luzs6CxWYU7XDwhXUzqow. 

💻 I'm available for job offers or also if you want me to join you on a project.
